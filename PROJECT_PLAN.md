## Resource Allocation

### Development Resources
- 1 Senior Developer (Lead): Integration and architecture
- 1 ML Engineer: AI components and ML integration
- 1 UI Developer: Streamlit dashboard enhancement
- 1 QA Engineer: Testing and validation

### Infrastructure
- Development environment with required packages
- Testing environment with multiple browser profiles
- API access for OpenAI/Anthropic services

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Job Board Detection**: Anti-bot measures may identify automation
   - **Mitigation**: Implement sophisticated anti-detection features and human-like behavior

2. **API Limitations**: Rate limits on OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching and optimize API usage

3. **Changing Job Board Layouts**: Sites may change UI frequently
   - **Mitigation**: Use vision capabilities for resilience to layout changes

4. **Authentication Challenges**: Login requirements on job boards
   - **Mitigation**: Implement secure cookie storage and session management

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Levels
1. **Unit Testing**: Individual components
2. **Integration Testing**: Component interaction
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end functionality
4. **Anti-Detection Testing**: Verification of undetectability

### Testing Focus Areas
- Resume parsing accuracy
- Job matching precision
- Form filling reliability
- Browser undetectability
- Error handling and recovery

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Development**: Initial implementation and component testing
2. **Staging**: Integration testing with mock job boards
3. **Limited Production**: Testing with real job boards (limited volume)
4. **Full Production**: Full-scale deployment with monitoring

## Post-Implementation

### Maintenance Plan
- Weekly code updates for any detected issues
- Monthly updates for job board changes
- Quarterly feature enhancements

### Success Metrics
- Job search efficiency (jobs found per hour)
- Match accuracy (percentage of relevant jobs)
- Application success rate
- Detection avoidance rate
